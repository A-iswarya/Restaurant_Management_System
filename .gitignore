# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/rails_backend/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rails_backend/log/*
/rails_backend/tmp/*
!/rails_backend/log/.keep
!/rails_backend/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/rails_backend/tmp/pids/*
!/rails_backend/tmp/pids/
!/rails_backend/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/rails_backend/storage/*
!/rails_backend/storage/.keep
/rails_backend/tmp/storage/*
!/rails_backend/tmp/storage/
!/rails_backend/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/rails_backend/config/master.key
